The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
<br>

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.
<br>

The columns in this dataset are:
<br>
Id<br>
SepalLengthCm<br>
SepalWidthCm<br>
PetalLengthCm<br>
PetalWidthCm<br>

##	KNN(K Nearest Neighbours):<br>

K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories. K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.<br>
Model yielded a accuracy score of 0.96.
